# UnionFind
Codes for the UnionFind assignment from Advanced Data Structures course in MIRI

For compilation, navigate to the project folder and just run the command "make", and then you can run the executable "unionfind.exe" to generate the TPL and TPU data.

The python script "plotdata.py" produces the cost plots (the ones that depend on epsilon), and "plotdata2.py" produces three plots that show the TPL and TPU data. They have to be run individually.

None of my codes takes input parameters, but they are all defined at the beggining of "experiments.cpp" and the python script if the reader would wish to modify them.
